    <a name="Force Sensor"><h1>Force Sensor</h1></a>

    <img src="Resources\forceGauge.png" />

    <p>
        The Futek force sensor is a critical component of the printing process. It's primary purpose is to
        monitor the force applied to its guage to determine when to stop the Z-Stage from moving up during
        a printing operation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The force sensor is the first component required to be connected - without it, neither the Z-Stage
        or Voltmeter can be connected. To connect to the force sensor, click the Force Sensor menu item
        and navigate to Enabled. Click On to begin the connection process. The force sensor will 
        automatically scan your USB ports for any connected sensor. If found, it will automatically
        supply the serial number for that particular sensor. If more than one sensor are connected,
        it will return the serial number of the sensor connected to the COM port with the lowest 
        number (ie, COM1). 
    </p>
    <p>
        If the provided serial number is not the correct one, the user can change the serial number before
        clicking the OK button. Once clicked, the connection process will begin and the feedback box will
        display all connection data. Once connected, the force reading will update automatically on the main
        user interface screen. It will, by default, be set to display its gross value - so it may not
        display 0g. To set the current value to 0g, navigate to the force sensor menu item and check
        Tare. This will tell the force sensor to use its current value as the 0 setting, and any 
        force applied will be checked against that tared value. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The force sensor will, by default, have its "stop value" set to 0.002g. The stop value is the 
        force value the program will use to determine when to stop the Z-Stage from moving during a 
        print operation. When the force sensor detects the stop value, it will fire an event that will
        automatically stop the Z-Stage from moving and finish the current print operation. To change the
        stop value at any time, there is a text box below the force value display, along with a button. 
        Input your new force stop value (in grams) here, and click the button to change the stop value.
    </p>
    <a name="Z-Stage"><h1>Z-Stage</h1></a>

    <img src="Resources\ZStage.png" />
    <p>
        The Z-Stage is a small stage that moves up or down, and is the primary component of the printing
        process. The Z-Stage has a travel range of 120 microns. By design, the Z-Stage moves to positions
        immediately - with their software, telling it to move to 120 microns from its starting position
        would be one "move" operation. This is not sufficient for the printing process. Instead, this program
        will simulate steady, controlled movement for the Z-Stage. To faciliate this, the program requires 
        a "step size" and a "speed" that the user will determine.
    </p>
    <p>
        To connect to the Z-Stage, click the Z-Stage menu item and navigate to Enabled. Click the On
        menu item. This will automatically begin the Z-Stage connection process - no input from the user is
        required, as the program will automatically detect the Z-Stage if it is connected to a USB port.
        Once connected, the user is free to manually move the Z-Stage up or down with the two Up or Down
        arrow buttons, or with the Move To Position input text box. The former method will move the Z-Stage
        in the desired direction at one "step" per click, by default. A step is roughly equivalent to a micron -
        therefore, clicking the Up arrow will move the Z-Stage up one micron, and vice versa for the Down arrow.
        The latter method will move the Z-Stage to the input position - the user types in the desired position into
        the text box, and clicks the green check mark next to it. If the position is valid (within the min and max 
        range of the Z-Stage, which is 0 and 105 respectively), the Z-Stage will automatically move to that position.
    </p>
    <p>
        By default, the click-move method will adhere to the force sensor stop value - it will not allow the user to manually
        move the Z-Stage beyond the stop value. The Move-To position method, however, will, by default, ignore the stop value
        and simply move the Z-Stage to the user-input position regardless of what force reading it detects. To also
        ignore the sensor during the click-move method, navigate to the Z-Stage menu item, click Settings, and then
        click the Ignore Sensor menu item. Now, during manual move, it will ignore the force sensor reading and move the 
        Z-Stage regardless of the stop value.
    </p>
    <p>
        To prepare the Z-Stage for the printing process, the Z-Stage must first be calibrated. Calibration will
        determine a rough "go to position" for the Z-Stage - the position the Z-Stage detects the stop value at. 
        To begin calibration, click the Z-Stage menu item and then the Calibrate menu item. This will open a new
        form that will handle the calibration process. On the main form, the user is only required to input
        a stop value and the starting position for the Z-Stage - both these will be filled in with default values,
        but the user is allowed to change them. To begin the process, the user must first click the Phase Settings
        button, which will take them to a separate form with input boxes for each setting for each stage of calibration.
    </p>
    <img src="Resources\calibration.png" />
    <p>
        Calibration is broken into four stages - Phases One through Four. Each phase can have a different
        step size, speed, and offset, allowing the user to measure the Z-Stage's ending position at the time
        the stop value is detected with different settings for the Z-Stage, to find a more "accurate" go-to position.
        It is generally a better idea to start with larger step sizes and speeds and reduce the step size, offset and speed
        with each subsequent phase. This will allow the earlier stages to find the go-to position quicker, and then to
        fine-tune the result with slower speeds at a smaller offset at the end. A larger step size and faster speed will
        result in less accurate results - it will often "overshoot" the stop value, giving a position that goes too far.
        A smaller offset, however, can also result in false triggers. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Each phase of calibration works as so: first, the Z-Stage will automatically move to a pre-determined position. 
        For phase one, it will jump to the starting position as determined in the main calibration form. For phases two
        through four, it will automatically jump the Z-Stage to the "go to position" - the position the Z-Stage 
        detected the stop value at minus the offset. Therefore, the offset must be input in the amount of microns
        you wish the Z-Stage to subtract from the force detected position. Once it jumps to the "go to position" 
        (or starting position for phase 1), it will then move the Z-Stage up by one step (as determined by user-input 
        step size, which is in microns) per speed setting (as determined by user-input speed, which is in milliseconds). 
        It will check the force value at each move operation. If it is at or exceeds the stop value, it will record the
        position of the Z-Stage at time of detection and create a go-to position by substracting the offset from
        that force detected position. On the next phase, it will jump the Z-Stage to that go-to position and resume
        the process, ideally at a smaller step-size and slower speed. If the offset is too small, the Z-Stage runs the
        risk of triggering the stop value prematurely. Too large, and it will take a long time for smaller step-sizes and
        speeds to detect the stop value. Regardless, once phase 4 is finished, it will record the go-to position and 
        finish calibration. The user then has the choice of accepting the calibration results or cancelling, which will
        reset the entire process and allow the user to re-do calibration.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a final menu item for the Z-Stage: Positions Found, which is located under the Settings menu for 
        the Z-Stage. This form will display the positions the Z-Stage detected the force stop value during
        calibration, along with the speed, step size and offset used for those phases of calibration.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once calibration is accepted, the user can connect to the Voltmeter. The voltmeter will watch for the 
        change in voltage from the 3D printer relay, which will trigger the printing process to begin. However, the user
        can also manually print by clicking Manual Print. The program will ask the user how many times to manually
        print, and the program will run a print operation as many times as the user selects. The user can also change
        Z-Stage settings under the Z-Stage Settings menu item. Here, the user can change step size, speed, offset,
        and other settings related to printing. More detail will be given on these settings in the Printing section
        of this tutorial.
    </p>
    <a name="Voltmeter"><h1>Voltmeter</h1></a>
    <img src="Resources\voltmeter.png" />
    <p>
        The Voltmeter measures the voltage from the 3D printer relay. Its purpose is to
        tell the program when to begin a printing operation - a positive change in voltage exceeding the
        user-determined voltage change-value will trigger the printing process to begin. The Voltmeter
        can only be connected once the Z-Stage has finished calibration and the user has accepted the
        calibration values. This is to prevent the Voltmeter from triggering the print process before
        the Z-Stage has properly been calibrated.
    </p>
    <p>
        To connect to the Voltmeter, simply click the Voltmeter menu item, click Enabled and then On. 
        The program will automatically detect the Voltmeter if it's connected to a USB port, and automatically
        establish a connection without any input from the user. The voltage value is displayed in red at the 
        bottom left of the main user interface screen. By default, the voltage change value is set to 1. 
        This means that if the voltage value changes by 1 (ie, 0 to 1, or 4 to 5), it will trigger the
        printing process. The user can alter this value by clicking the Voltmeter menu item, 
        then navigating to the Voltage Change menu item. Here the user can input a new value for the 
        Voltmeter to detect. The change value must be greater than 0. If the user sets it to 5, the
        printing process will only trigger if the voltmeter experiences a positive change of 5 or greater 
        (ie, 0 to 5 or 50 to 55). It will not trigger on a negative change - ie, 5 to 0. 
    </p>
    <a name="XYZ-Stage"><h1>XYZ-Stage</h1></a>
    <img src="Resources\xyzStage.png" />
    <p>
        The XYZ-Stage is another stage that can be used for the printing process. It is inaccurate compared to the Z-Stage,
        as it is prone to hysteresis and relies on friction to move its motors. There are six motors in all, each one 
        connected to one of three drivers. The drivers are in turn connected to one parent driver, which is connected
        to the computer via a serial-to-USB converter. The XYZ-Stage can move in any direction, unlike the Z-Stage,
        but it does not remember the positions of its motors - while the Z-Stage will retain its current position, even
        after disconnecting and reconnecting, the XYZ-Stage will forget the position of each motor if you disconnect it.
        The program itself defines only drivers and channels (which correspond to the motors). However, it does not know
        which driver is actually connected to which physical driver, nor which physical motors are connected to
        the physical driver. Thus, it is recommended to label each physical driver and motor to correspond
        to the ambigious designations on the XYZ-Stage control panel - Drivers A to C, and channels A to C for
        each driver.
    </p>
    <p>
        Connecting to the XYZ-Stage does not depend on any other hardware being connected, and thus can be connected
        independently of the other components. To connect, simply click the XYZ-Stage menu item and click
        Display. This will open a dialog box which will ask the user which COM Port the XYZ-Stage is connected to.
        The user must know beforehand what COM port the XYZ-Stage is connected to (COM1, COM2, ..., COM9, etc). 
        Once connected, the XYZ-Stage will perform a small calibration test to determine its drivers and
        motors are working correctly. It will then take the user to the XYZ-Stage control panel.
    </p>
    <img src="Resources\xyzStageGUI.png" />
    <p>
        The panel itself is divided into three separate but identical panels - one for each of the three physical drivers. 
        Not all have to be connected to operate the XYZ-Stage - a driver can only control three motors (channels), 
        and only one at a time, and since  there are six motors in all, you only need to activate the driver that is
        controlling the motor you wish to move. However, to move the XYZ-Stage up or down in one linear fashion, each
        driver will have to be activated and added to the group - since a driver can only move one motor at a time,
        you will need the three motors responsible for Z movement connected to one driver each. Each driver will have to
        be added to the group, and the group move button will then cause all three drivers to move their respective motor
        at the same time (assuming that the channels you activated for that driver correspond to the Z axis motor). 
    </p>
    <p>
        Since a driver can only control one motor at a time, before you can enable a driver you have to select a channel
        for that driver, A, B or C. However, since there are six motors (or six channels), but up to nine channels on the
        software, some channels will be inactive - that is, activating that channel will do nothing as that channel 
        on that driver is not connected to a physical motor. Thus it is best to ensure you properly label the physical motors
        to tell which channel is corresponding to which motor on which driver. Once you have selected the proper channel
        and enabled the driver, it will open a new panel under that driver control with all the controls needed for
        operating the driver. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two movement modes for each driver - position or velocity mode. Position mode will move that driver's
        motor to the input position. Speed and acceleration values are required before a move can be initiated. The user
        also has the choice of choosing Abrupt or Smooth stop modes. The position of that driver/motor will be reported
        in the bottom right corner of the control panel. Velocity mode does not move the motor to an input position - instead, 
        it depends on the right or left arrow buttons (which appear when velocity mode is engaged). The motor will move
        as long as the user is holding down on the arrow, and the position will update accordingly in the bottom-right.
    </p>
    <p>
        Adding the connected driver to a group will add that driver to the group control box at the bottom of the screen.
        Group mode will move all the added drivers in one single movement - however, that driver must be set to
        Position mode before the group can be moved, as group mode requires position data. Each driver must have position, 
        speed and acceleration data input before the group can be moved. However, each driver can have their own trajectory
        data - when the group moves, each driver will stop at their own position, so one driver can continue moving
        even as the others in the group stop, and at their own speed and acceleration. Group leader is not an important
        feature, but it is required for the group to move - any of the added drivers can be chosen as the leader, but it will
        not actually affect the move operation. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember that the XYZ-Stage cannot remember position data. Once you exit the program, the positions of each
        motor will be forgotten. Restarting the program will display the position of each driver as 0, regardless of 
        where they actually are on the physical hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
        Important Note: Each driver MUST have one physical motor connected to its Channel A slot in order for
        the XYZ-Stage to work.
    </p>
    <a name="Printing"><h1>Printing Process</h1></a>
    <p>
        The printing process the primary focus of this program - to automatically engage the printing process
        for the 3D printer with minimal user input. Upon detecting the proper voltage change, the Z-Stage will
        automatically move up until it detects the stop value, whereupon it will stop and allow the ink to dwell. 
        When it finishes dwelling, it will return to its starting position and repeat at the next 
        voltage trigger. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The printing process can only begin if the force sensor is connected, the Z-Stage has finished calibration, and
        if the Voltmeter is connected. The settings for the Z-Stage can be altered in the Z-Stage menu item panel, under 
        the Settings Panel item. Here, the user has many settings to choose and alter.
    </p>
    <img src="Resources\zStageSettings.png" />
    <p>
        Step Size: The change in position with very move for the Z-Stage. This is measured approximately in a 1:1 ratio
        in microns. So a step size of 1 will move the Z-Stage up or down 1 micron with every successful move.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Speed: The amount of time between each move for the Z-Stage, in milliseconds. A speed of 1000 will pause the Z-Stage
        1 second every time it makes a move (the size of the move determined by the step size).
    </p>
    <p>
        Offset: The amount of microns to offset the Z-Stage's force detected position to determine a go-to position. 
        It operates the same way as in calibration mode. During printing, if Force-Limited mode is engaged, the Z-Stage
        will typically detect the stop value at different positions for each print operation. This is a result of 
        many factors - the force sensor is very sensitive, and the Z-Stage is not moving with perfect accuracy. Thus, the
        force detected position will often be different between prints. To accomodate this, the go-to position is 
        automatically changed every print (if Force-Limited mode is on). To determine the go-to position, the offset
        is required. The formula for the go-to position is force detected position minus the offset. In print 1, 
        the go-to position is 30, as determined by the final phase of calibration. The offset is set to 3. Thus, the force
        detected position was 33. During the print, the Z-Stage will automatically move to position 30 and then begin
        moving to position 33 at its step size and speed. It detects the stop value at position 34, dwells, and then
        calculates the new go-to position as 31 (34 minus 3). 
    </p>
    <p>
        Dwell Time: The amount of time, in milliseconds, that the Z-Stage pauses when it detects the stop value. This is to
        give the ink time to dwell on the surface. The Z-Stage will remain at the position it detected the force stop
        value for as many seconds as input in the dwell time, and then return to its go-to position upon completion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Print Go-To Position: Although the go-to position is automatically determined by the program, the user is given
        the option of manually determining the go-to position for one print operation. This is generally not recommended, but is
        there if needed. After changing the go-to position, the program will go to that position for the next print, but
        at the completion of that print, it will generate a new go-to position automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
        Print Stop Mode: There are two options to select - Force-Limited and Position-Limited modes. Force-Limited mode
        will stop the Z-Stage from moving during a print when the stop value is detected. Position-limited mode, however,
        will stop the Z-Stage at the previous force-detected position, regardless of the stop value. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Print Return Mode: There are two options to select - Jump-Down and Step-Down modes. Jump-Down mode 
        will automatically return the Z-Stage to its go-to position after dwelling. Step-down mode, however, will
        return the Z-Stage to either the go-to position or to position zero in steps. The step-down size and the
        return speed are both determined by the user in the Print Return Step and Print Return Speed 
        boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Print Return Step Size: This input box is there to set the step size of the Z-Stage during Step-Down mode
        as the Z-Stage is returning after dwelling. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Print Return Speed: This input box is there to set the speed, in milliseconds, of the Z-Stage during Step-Down mode
        as the Z-Stage is returning after dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
        Slow Down?: This check box is a special mode for the Z-Stage. It works by slowing the Z-Stage down during
        a print as it approaches the stop value. When the program detects a value 0.0005g less than the stop value,
        it will trigger the slow-down mode. It will set the Z-Stage's step size to the Slow-Down step size, which is
        input into the input box next to the Slow-Down mode check box. The Z-Stage will then continue moving to
        the stop value, but at this new step size. The speed will remain the same. This mode cannot be activated 
        if the Position-Limited mode is engaged, as the Position-Limited mode does not rely on the force stop value
        to determine when to stop the Z-Stage.
    </p>
    <a name="Tracking"><h1>Z-Stage Tracking</h1></a>
    <img src="Resources\trackingmode.png" />
    <p>
        Z-Stage Tracking is a special mode that can be enabled once Z-Stage calibration has finished and the Voltmeter is connected.
        To access it, navigate to the Z-Stage menu item and click Trading Mode. This will take the user to a new form
        specifically geared to Tracking.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tracking mode is simple - it will trigger a Z-Stage "print" operation every time it detects the voltage change, 
        and then record the position it detects the stop value at. The user can keep tracking mode on as long as needed - it will
        continue to record position and force data as many times as the voltage is detected. Unlike a print operation, settings
        such as Position-Limited, Slow-Down, and Step-Down are ignored; it simply moves the Z-Stage until it detects the stop value,
        records the position it reached and the force value, and then repeats on the next voltage trigger. Nothing will
        happen until the user clicks the Begin Tracking button - if this button is not clicked, even a voltage trigger
        will not cause anything to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the user is finished, they can click Stop Tracking, which will end the tracking process. The user then has the 
        option of clicking the Export Data button. This will open a Save File dialog. What this will do is save a spreadsheet
        to the user's local file system. This spreadsheet will contain all the positions found during the tracking process,
        along with the force value at that position.
    </p>
    <p>
        This mode is designed to test surfaces - the user will have to program the 3D printer software with a special
        pattern, moving the printing arm in 10 micron increments and then triggering the relay to send the voltage
        to this program. The Z-Stage will then move up and detect the stop value at a certain position. Since the 3D printer
        arm is moving in 10 micron increments, the user can map out a surface by recording the position and force 10 microns
        apart.
